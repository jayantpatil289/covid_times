00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.330
Hello, I am Dr. Bhooshan Shukla. 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Today is 21st March 2020. 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Many of you have many different questions about Coronavirus. 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I am a Child Psychiatrist and I work in Pune.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I have been receiving many calls from parents since the last two weeks,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000 
regarding how should we talk to our kids?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000 
what should we do? 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000 
what should we tell them?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000 
There is an environment of care and caution everywhere.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000 
Since kids are to stay at home, this has become a concern for all parents.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000 
This is why I have created this short video for you.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000 
If you find these tips useful, I will be very happy.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000 
The first thing to note is that ‘being worried’ or ‘being scared’ could be an aspect of the child’s temperament

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000 
But more importantly, children base their reactions by seeing the reactions of adults around them.
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000 
So in your home, if you have an environment where 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
mom-dad, grandmom-grandpa are constantly reading WhatsApp forwards from various sources, 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
are loudly discussing about it, 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.500
and there is an environment of fear in the house, 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.000
then this obviously troubles the children.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The concern that you express about a contagious disease,
 
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
ends up being contagious too.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Such an irony.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Hence, only spend a little time looking at these things

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And honestly speaking, 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
regularly washing hands,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Not going close to people,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And staying away from old people to avoid infecting them,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
are three simple rules [that we must follow].

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Are these worth spending 5 hours on WhatsApp? 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
If you have understood these three simple rules,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And you are willing to abide by them,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And if your heartbeats start rising by reading messages on social media

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Then please, first limit your access to social media.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Because apart from these simple rules, there is not much you can do right now.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Wait a little. Take care of these few basic rules. 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Let there be less worry on your face.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Sit with your children.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Now when kids ask you questions, what should you tell them?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Because kids [might] think something terrible is going to happen,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Are people going to die? What is going to happen?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
The truthful answer to this right now is

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Right now, we are taking precautions because this disease could be dangerous.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
So we are taking these precautions

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
To try that this disease doesn’t reach us at all. 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Right now, we should all keep our focus on these attempts.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Let’s keep our full focus on this 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and let’s not unnecessarily discuss all the [other worrying topics]. 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
This is a very important thing.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
The third thing. Since kids are at home all day. You are at home. What are you going to do?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.500
Please take note. 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.000
The best solution to both: boredom and anxiety,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
The absolute best medicine for both is To Act With Your Hands.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
So become active. 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Don’t sit idly in the same place and keep looking at the screen all the time.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Read something good, discuss about it. 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
There are many chores to do, cleaning to do,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Many items [to declutter], many documents to take care of, need to arrange things,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Need to clean cupboards, need to declutter useless things, 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Are you going to get a bigger opportunity than this?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Use this opportunity.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
There are toys at home. Lego blocks. Puzzles. Start working on those.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Let’s do minor repairs at home. Let’s fix light sockets. Let’s fix small [appliances].

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Let’s fix leaky taps at home. 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Let’s teach kids to use screws, wrench, hammer, nail, etc.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Let’s clean vegetables. Let’s make curry. Let’s cook. Let’s help [with home chores].

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Let’s do cleaning. For many, the domestic help [might be unavailable]. 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Let’s learn to do those things ourselves.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.500
Let’s teach the kids to iron. 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.000
There are a ton of tasks to do. In fact, 15 days might be less to finish all these tasks.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
The biggest remedy for anxiety..

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
..is Positive Action.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Who are your neighbours? 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Do they have sufficient resources at home?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Are there any needy elderly nearby? 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Your building’s watchmen.. your domestic help.. Do they have the means to survive?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Do they need any help? 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Do this.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Teach your kids to wash the vehicle with one bucket of water. 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000
These are simple activities that you and your kids can do together. Definitely do these.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Now there are few things that you shouldn’t do.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Our homes are small. They aren’t mansions. 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
We [all] live in 1, 2, or max-3 bedroom apartments.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000 
Sitting together in a small [constrained] space causes irritability. 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000
So do not discuss troublesome topics, old topics, unpleasant experiences.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.500
Definitely discuss the good and pleasant topics.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.000
And parents, "This is a good chance."

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
"Kids are now stuck. And now [we should preach]." 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Please don’t do this. 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Kids are not at all interested in listening to your life’s philosophy.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
So let’s teach kids to work with their hands. Let’s teach them useful things. 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And during this quarantine, 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
during this self-imposed Janata-Curfew for a day

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Staying at home. Working from home.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Let’s spend this time wisely. Let’s be positive.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000 
Let’s regularly wash our hands. 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000 
Let’s [come together] only at [our] homes. 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Let’s not go outside. Let’s not come in contact with anyone. 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Let’s take care of the elders. Let’s take care of the young. 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Live in happiness. Stay happy. Stay safe. 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Do take precaution. But don’t take tension.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Don’t get paralyzed with anxiety. Don’t die with anxiety. 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Stay safe. Stay positive. Live in Happiness. 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Jai Hind!
